# Welcome to My GitHub Skills Journey 🚀

Hi, I'm Iqbal Singh — and this is my first GitHub Skills exercise!

## What is this?

This repository is part of the **"Introduction to GitHub"** exercise provided by GitHub Skills. It's a hands-on activity to help beginners understand:

- How to create branches
- How to make commits
- How to open pull requests
- How to merge changes

## Why GitHub?

GitHub is a powerful platform for building projects, sharing code, and collaborating with others. Whether you're a developer, student, or just curious — GitHub makes version control and teamwork simple.

## What I’ve Learned So Far:

- ✅ Created a branch  
- ✅ Committed a file  
- 🔜 Open a pull request  
- 🔜 Merge the pull request  

## Next Steps

Keep following the instructions from the GitHub Skills bot in the **Issues** tab. After completing this, I'll have a basic but solid understanding of using GitHub!
